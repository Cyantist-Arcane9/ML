Machine Learning TryOuts !
===================


Hey! Firstly good to see you. This repo consists of basic ml algorithm **(in Python 3.5)** and their day to day example. Ml algorithm are:

1: Income-Age grouping using **K-Means Clustering**
2: Spam Filter using **Naive Bayes**
3: Decision making for candidate via Resume using **Decision Tree**
4: Predicting the group of people based on previous income-age class using **Support Vector Machines**
